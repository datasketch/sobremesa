    When working with La Sobremesa in creating possible Futures to prioritize actions and adjust our institutional development plan, we felt that they cared about the future of our organization as if it were their own. They have a capacity to listen and empathize that is not common in these fields (of consultants). Their priority was to ensure that our alternative development vision could become a reality.

    It was a pleasure working with Anca and the team. The process was like a journey, starting from defining the destination and what we want to achieve with the process; planning and preparing all the important elements for the conversations we are going to embark on; navigating and exploring the ideas, ambitions, and fears of the team; to landing reflections on concrete and manageable proposals. La Sobremesa is not just a consultancy, it is a 'thought partner' and guide.

    La Sobremesa provided us with a holistic consultancy on the sustainability of our organization. It ranged from presentations and workshops to several in-depth conversations, joint document development, and recommendations. It was an EXCELLENT experience. The conversations were all relevant, we learned a lot and saw many new aspects of the topic. Very important to highlight the flexibility of the entire consultancy (and consultants) to adapt to our needs and times, as well as the constant accompaniment!

    Working with La Sobremesa was a very good experience as they challenged us to truly think about the meaning of impact and how we can not only measure it internally but also account for it. The La Sobremesa team accompanied us in these reflections with a very clear methodology and some excellent facilitators. Thanks, colleagues!

    La Sobremesa's accompaniment work during our Design Phase was very comprehensive, complete, harmonious, reflective, and generated an atmosphere of trust and integration. They were spaces where debates were triggered and agreements were reached collectively and respectfully; also, each space was interconnected, and the continuity was always felt in each of them.

    Working with La Sobremesa marks a turning point in our institutional history. They accompanied us in co-creating and defining a roadmap for our organization. As part of that technical assistance, they helped us define mechanisms in Dialogos on how we anticipate futures and learn from them. We truly enjoyed working with La Sobremesa. Thanks to their inspiration and support, we were able to achieve the objectives and goals we set for ourselves. A work like this deserves to be properly recognized, so thank you for dedicating so much time, love, and effort to our project.

    We are working with La Sobremesa on a project to explore how collaborations in the area of ​​civic technology for accountability emerge, evolve and (sometimes) fail, and what can be learned from these experiences to better support to the community. As in our previous work with Anca and the team, it was a wonderful experience, full of learning. Among the many great qualities they bring to this job, one of the most impressive is their ability to create spaces of trust, honest, warm (and fun) conversations that go much deeper than usual and provide critical ideas for next steps!
