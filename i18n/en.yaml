    As part of our work with [Open Contracting
    Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) (done as part of our work as
    Agency), we interviewed support organizations that conduct accompaniment
    support. We wanted to understand what types of support most benefitted
    organizations that wanted to improve their implementation of open
    contracting work.

    There are many kinds of support but, in reality, many don’t work. In order
    to improve accompaniment practices, we need to listen to the voices of the
    people who are receiving this support.
