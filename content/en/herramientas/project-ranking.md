We created this tool after many interactions with organizations that wanted to better understand when to take on a new project and invest their time and energy in it. This ranking allows you to identify which of your projects has been the most strategic in the past. To do so, you must ask yourself the right questions. This tool systematizes some of those basic questions, such as: How does it align with your mission? Which one has had the greatest impact? And which one has provided the most funding? among other variables. The exercise of answering these questions with your team will provide valuable insights for making decisions about future projects.
