From "La Sobremesa," we created this tool after assisting numerous organizations in developing their Sustainability Strategies. Its objective is to guide you when mapping and studying potential donors. When you're seeking to diversify your organization's funds, thoroughly researching new donors is important, asking questions such as: Who do they fund? Where? In what areas? For how much money? And how to apply? among other questions that this tool suggests. One of the best ways to start is by utilizing the "Competitor Analysis" (see tool on our website) to understand who funds organizations similar to yours.
