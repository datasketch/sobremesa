The tools in this manual are not necessarily designed for the many talented gurus of organizational effectiveness (OE) in the world, although we believe the manual will be a positive contribution to the existing OE toolbox. They are user-friendly, quick, cost-effective, and specific tools to help anyone, regardless of their prior experience in OE, to start the capacity conversation, download and organize valuable information that already exists, initiate basic capacity assessments and planning, and highlight key strategic capacity and effectiveness issues and trends within a nonprofit organization.
