In this video and exercise, you will hear about how 'establishing a theory of change... is like creating a roadmap that outlines the steps you plan to take to achieve your goal. It helps you define whether your work is contributing to the impact you envision and if there are other approaches you should also consider. The Theory of Change tool not only helps articulate and clearly connect your work to your larger goal, but it also allows you to identify potential risks in your plan by sharing the underlying assumptions at each step.
