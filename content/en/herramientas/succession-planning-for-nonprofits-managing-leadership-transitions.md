This tool provides key information about leadership transitions within organizations, or in other words, director successions. According to the most recent BoardSource report (2021), only 29% of NGOs have a written transition plan. The importance of thoughtful planning is crucial, as unexpected or anticipated transitions can pose significant challenges. The proper handling of these processes is essential to ensure the continuity and success of the organization.
