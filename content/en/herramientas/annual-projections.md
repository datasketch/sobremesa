At La Sobremesa, we created this tool - that has two exercises - after accompanying many organizations in their Sustainability Plans. This tool guides you in creating financial projections for the next year, based off of the costs of three scenarios - minimum, medium, and ideal. With these three scenarios, you can create different routes to achieve your projections, with different combinations of streams of income.
