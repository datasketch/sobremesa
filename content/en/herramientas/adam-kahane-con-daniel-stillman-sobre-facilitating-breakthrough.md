<!--StartFragment-->

In this podcast, we hear from Adam Kahane, who has over 30 years of experience facilitating breakthroughs at the highest levels of government and society. He has facilitated conversations about South Africa in the early days of the country's transition to democracy and the end of apartheid, the conclusion of civil wars in Colombia, the transformation of the food system, and almost everything else. He is also surprisingly open and honest about his growth and transformation as a facilitator, as well as his own failures along the way.
