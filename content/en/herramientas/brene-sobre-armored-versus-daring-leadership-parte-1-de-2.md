In this podcast, it discusses 'The biggest barrier to bold leadership is not fear; the biggest barrier is armor, or how we self-protect when we are afraid. This is Part I of a two-part series, where Brené Brown explores the most common types of armor, which include being a knower versus being a learner, opting out of a difficult conversation versus improving and leaning in, and using shame and guilt to manage others versus using accountability and empathy.
