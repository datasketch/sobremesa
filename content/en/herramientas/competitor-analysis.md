We developed this tool from "La Sobremesa" after assisting numerous organizations in developing their Sustainability Strategies. It enables organizations to systematically research their "competitors" â€” or in many cases, their allies or sources of inspiration. They can use this tool to investigate their organization's mission and communication style, their projects, services, or funding sources. They can draw inspiration from organizations within their own countries and regions, on the one hand, and also from outside these, to understand how they are funded, who funds them, and which projects receive that funding.
