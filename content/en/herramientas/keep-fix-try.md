When developing a strategy, completing a process or project, or reviewing ways of working with your team, it is essential to look inward and reflect. You should create a space with all relevant individuals to ask yourself three simple yet powerful questions: (1) "What should we keep from this process - why did it work well for us?" (Keep); (2) "What should we fix - why didn't it work out as well?" (Fix); and finally, (3) "What should we attempt to improve in the future?" (Try).
