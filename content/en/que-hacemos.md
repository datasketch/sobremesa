## What do we work on? #{class="section-title section-col-title text-chocolate"}

> We created La Sobremesa to address problems that we see over and over again in civil society: we do a lot with very little, with timelines that are imposed on us, making it hard to stop and take stock.

Given this pressure that civil society has to deal with - from donors, colleagues and counterparts - organizations and the people in them need a moment to pause, to reflect and learn. It’s always better to do this in community, with good company, at La Sobremesa.

**At La Sobremesa we want a strong, resilient and innovative civil society,** whose leaders, organizations and networks have everything they need to be able to focus on creating a positive impact in Latin America.

**To do this, we create learning spaces, identify tools for transformation and provide direct support** for organizations and civil society leaders in Latin America, so that they can generate the impact they seek in innovative, healthy and unique ways.

**Our Vision: At La Sobremesa, we envision a strong, resilient, and innovative civil society** where leaders, organizations, and networks have everything they need to focus on creating a positive impact in Latin America.

**Our Mission: To achieve this, we facilitate spaces for learning, provide transformational tools, and offer personalized accompaniments** to civil society organizations and leaders in Latin America, enabling them to generate the impact they seek in innovative, healthy, and personalized ways.

In many Latin American countries, a "sobremesa" is the moment after a meal in which we deepen our conversation, often over dessert, coffee or a drink of choice. It is an open space full of important conversations. The moment can be relaxed or provoke intense discussions – but it’s always a collective space, full of trust.

## How do we work? #{class="mt-16 section-title section-col-title text-chocolate"}

> We are a team of designers and facilitators of change processes, supporting civil society organizations to more deeply understand their challenges and co-create effective ideas and solutions.

- **We work towards a healthy and resilient civil society**, built on trust and collaboration at all levels: between donors and organizations, network and their members, and within organizations themselves.
- **We facilitate with empathy, honesty, and vulnerability** to build trust with our partners, a practice rooted in feminist values and practices.
- **We openly and honestly address the power dynamics** present in our relationships and the system, working to transform them towards greater equity.
- **We keep people at the center of our work** because we believe they are the experts of their own realities and experiences. We provide them with the space to reflect, evolve, and learn.
- **We believe that the processes of reflection and learning** are just as important as the final results. For us, the "how" we provide support is just as significant as the “what” or the final product.
- **We facilitate personalized processes that adapt to you**, your specific needs, and challenges, motivating you to explore and grow beyond your comfort zone.
