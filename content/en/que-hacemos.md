## What do we work on? #{class="section-title section-col-title text-chocolate"}

> We created La Sobremesa to address problems that we see over and over again in civil society: we do a lot with very little, with timelines that are imposed on us, making it hard to stop and take stock.

Given this pressure that civil society has to deal with - from donors, colleagues and counterparts - organizations and the people in them need a moment to pause, to reflect and learn. It’s always better to do this in community, with good company, at La Sobremesa.

**At La Sobremesa we want a strong, resilient and innovative civil society,** whose leaders, organizations and networks have everything they need to be able to focus on creating a positive impact in Latin America.

**To do this, we create learning spaces, identify tools for transformation and provide direct support** for organizations and civil society leaders in Latin America, so that they can generate the impact they seek in innovative, healthy and unique ways.

In many Latin American countries, a "sobremesa" is the moment after a meal in which we deepen our conversation, often over dessert, coffee or a drink of choice. It is an open space full of important conversations. The moment can be relaxed or provoke intense discussions – but it’s always a collective space, full of trust.

## How do we work? #{class="mt-16 section-title section-col-title text-chocolate"}

> We are a group of designers and facilitators of processes. We work together with civil society organizations to better understand the roots of their challenges, generate ideas, and experiment with solutions.

- We want a healthy and resilient civil society with trust at all levels - between donors and the organizations they support, between members of networks and coalitions, and between people on a team.
- We lead with empathy, with the openness and vulnerability required to generate the necessary trust, and are inspired by feminist values ​​and practices.
- We openly and honestly discuss the power dynamics at play in our relationships, in order to transform them.
- We keep people at the center of our conversations and believe that everyone can benefit from time to think and rethink.
- We believe that reflection and learning processes are just as important as final products.
- We facilitate processes that adapt to you, your context and your challenges, while pushing you out of your comfort zone.
