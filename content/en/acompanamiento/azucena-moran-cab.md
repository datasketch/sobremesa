With CabildoxLatAm, "La Sobremesa supported the design and facilitation of our week-long virtual, interactive workshop, CabildoxLatAm, a space for transnational, digital participation to identify and strengthen community responses to the COVID19 pandemic."

Working with La Sobremesa was a wonderful experience. They created space for trust and laughter,  sharing our struggles and losses, all in a digital space for citizen participation, that is CabildoxLatAm.
