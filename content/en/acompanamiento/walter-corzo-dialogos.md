With Dialogos de Guatemala, "La Sobremesa accompanied us in the **co-creation and definition of a roadmap** for our organization. As part of this technical assistance, La Sobremesa helped us define mechanisms around how we **anticipate futures and learn from them.**\"

We really enjoyed working with La Sobremsa. Thanks to their inspiration and accompaniment, **we were able to meet the objectives and goals that we proposed.** Work like this deserves to be recognized, so thank you to La Sobremesa for dedicating so much time, love and effort to our project. The work with La Sobremesa marks a "before and after" in our institutional history.
