With Ciudadanía Inteligente, "La Sobremesa provided us with **a holistic consultancy on the sustainability of our organization**. It ranged from presentations and workshops to several in-depth conversations, joint document development, and recommendations." 

"It was an **EXCELLENT experience**. The conversations were all relevant, we learned a lot and saw many new aspects of the topic. **Very important to highlight the flexibility of the entire consultancy (and consultants) to adapt to our needs and times, as well as the constant accompaniment!**"
