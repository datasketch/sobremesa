With Global Integrity, "La Sobremesa provided great support in facilitating a participatory process in which **we improved our approach to communicating our services and impact as an organization**." 

"It was a tremendous pleasure working **with Anca and the La Sobremesa team. They invest the time necessary to really understand your priorities and needs as an organization, which then translates into great results**. The entire Global Integrity team really enjoyed their facilitation, and their recommendations have helped us improve our strategy."
