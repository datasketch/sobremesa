With Oxfam México, "It was a pleasure working with Anca and the team. The process was like a journey, starting from defining the destination and what we want to achieve with the process; planning and preparing all the important elements for the conversations we are going to embark on; navigating and exploring the ideas, ambitions, and fears of the team; to landing reflections on concrete and manageable proposals. La Sobremesa is not just a consultancy, it is a 'thought partner' and guide."
