With Open Heroines, La Sobremesa designed and facilitated a collaborative process to investigate our Open Heroines network in a very participative way, with a focus on power dynamics.

The La Sobremesa team was very respectful, careful, and rigorous. The outcome of our work together brought us good perspectives for our community and helped us create sustainable strategies for the future.
