With Hivos Innovation Fund, "we worked with La Sobremesa on a project to explore how collaborations in the area of civic technology for accountability arise, evolve and (sometimes) fail, and what can be learned from these experiences to better support to the community."

As was the case in our previous work with Anca and the team, it was a wonderful experience, full of learning. Among the many great qualities they bring to this job, one of the most impressive is their ability to create spaces of trust, honest conversation, warmth (and fun) that go much deeper than usual and provide critical ideas for next steps!
