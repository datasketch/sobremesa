With International Republican Institute, "Working with La Sobremesa was a seamless experience, and one of the best experiences we've had with an external trainer designing workshops for our partners. La Sobremesa provided two in-depth workshops to capacitate our grantee partners on how to think about and achieve greater financial sustainability. La Sobremesa listened carefully, regularly collaborated with our team, and produced tailored guidance and materials that was exactly meeting the needs of our grantees. We couldn't recommend working with La Sobremesa more!".
