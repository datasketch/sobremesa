With TEDIC from Paraguay, "we worked with La Sobremesa to rethink possible futures, in order to be less reactive and more proactive. They also helped us rethink the organization â€“ from our mission and theory of change to our roles as a team and healthier, more sustainable ways of working."

Working with La Sobremesa was a delightful experience. We used many tools to think about our futures. They have a great team of professionals who accompanied us in the process of rebuilding the organization. Also, in the era of the pandemic, they shared methodologies that kept our team safe.
