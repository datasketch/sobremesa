I use  methodologies from different disciplines to facilitate processes of action and transformation – some of these include social innovation, critical design, participatory futures and systems thinking. I believe in narratives as critical tools for change, and I enjoy participatory design and co-creation.\nDue to my profile and curious mind, I have worked with various groups and organizations from both the public and private sectors and civil society. I've also worked with international institutions such as UNESCO, WFP and the EU on various social and environmental issues.",
